# New Years Bingo Card!

Like the idea of making new years resolutions, but find yourself never following through with them? ðŸ¤” Try making a resolutions bingo card!

I was inspired by [mangi.fy's tiktok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@magni.fy/video/7452968731505954094?q=new%20year%20bingo&t=1737949857647) to create a digital bingo card generator. All you have to do is come up with 25 goals, and the script will print them out in a random order!
